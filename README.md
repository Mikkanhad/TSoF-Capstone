# TSoF-Capstone
Computer Game Science Major Capstone Project

Corrupted is a Dungeons and Dragons themed, beat-em-up style game that required three players 
to play the game because running through a Dungeons and Dragons campaign is more fun with friends.

This is the version of my Capstone Project with Team Staff of Fireballs prior to the addition
of the ReWired Plugin that was meant to fix most of our issues regarding controller support 
across various controller types.
